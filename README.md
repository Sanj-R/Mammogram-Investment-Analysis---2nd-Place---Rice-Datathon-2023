#### 2nd Place Winner - Beginner Challenge

**Problem Description:** The FDA has received an international grant to provide mammography equipment and training to currently uncertified medical facilities nationwide. The FDA needs your help to identify characteristics of facilities where the allocation of their funds would make the greatest impact. To accomplish this, you have been provided with two datasets: the FDA Certified Mammograms Facility Dataset (beginner.csv) which provides information on all currently certified mammography facilities in the United States, and a 2019 Census Dataset (sc-est2019-agesex-civ.csv) which contains information regarding the age, sex, and race compositions of state populations in the United States from 2010-2019. Using these datasets, analyze the characteristics of already certified facilities and state populations to determine gaps in current mammography coverage in order to help the FDA allocate their funds. You are not required to but may choose to select an additional dataset of your choosing to complete your project.
